A demo Express app for projects participating in xExchange Discover program.

## Quick start

1. Run `npm install` to install the app.
2. Run `npm start` to start the app on port 3000 (this can be changed in `server.js`).

## Configuration

The application expects a wallet (by default `signer.pem`) file to exist at the root level.

You can update the path for this inside `generateResponses.js`.
